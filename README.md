simple auto car parking system using infrared and ultrasonic sensor


Scope for Future Work


 Accuracy can be increased by including more number of sensor each sensor detecting
individual values which is compared to get suitable distance and move the car into the
position it can also find the slot for parallel parking
 Auto calibration of sensor is required if IR sensors are used for different lighting
condition
 Better line sensing ability this also includes image processing technique to help the
car to detect line in accurate manner.
 Protection for sensors from mechanical damage due to mechanical actions while
moving in road like bumps etc.
 Sensing obstacle while taking reverse so the car must wait for the vehicle behind to
clear, provision also can be made to honk for a while to clear the road.
